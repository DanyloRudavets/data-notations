    <h2>AI Definition</h2>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"
        target="_blank"
        >Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a
      >
      refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks
      typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include
      problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and
      making decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      AI is a broad field that encompasses various subfields and techniques,
      such as machine learning,

      >, robotics, and computer vision.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
    <p>
      AI is used as voice assistants. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa use AI
      to understand and respond to voice commands. Platforms like Netflix and
      Amazon use AI to recommend products or shows based on your previous
      interactions. AI enables self-driving cars to navigate roads and make
      driving decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data in the table shows four main areas of AI application: natural
      language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and reinforcement
      learning. Each area is related to a specific application, such as
      chatbots, medical image analysis systems, or autonomous vehicles. These
      applications have a significant impact on various sectors, improving the
      efficiency of customer service, medical diagnostics, protection against
      financial fraud, and the development of modern technologies such as
      self-driving cars.

    <h2>Key Concepts in AI</h2>
    <p>
      In relation to artificial intelligence, the following key concepts can be
      distinguished:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Machine Learning (ML):</dt>
      <dd>
        A subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve over
        time without being explicitly programmed. Examples include
        recommendation systems (like Netflix or YouTube) and fraud detection.
      </dd>
      <dt>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</dt>
      <dd>
        A branch of AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret,
        and generate human language. Applications include voice assistants like
        <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri" target="_blank">Siri</a> or
        Alexa, chatbots, and language translation systems.
      </dd>
      <img
        src="https://accessibleweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amazon-1024x576.jpg"
        alt="Amazon Alexa"
        style="width: 150px; height: 100px"
      />
      <dt>Computer Vision:</dt>
      <dd>
        Enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data
        from the world, such as images and videos. It's widely used in facial
        recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Robotics: AI powers robots, giving them the ability to perform tasks
        autonomously, often in environments that are too dangerous or complex
        for humans.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Expert Systems: AI-based systems designed to mimic human expertise in
        specific domains, such as medical diagnosis or financial
        decision-making.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
    <p>
      AI continues to grow and impact various fields such as healthcare,
      education, finance, and manufacturing. However, ethical considerations,
      such as job displacement, privacy concerns, and AI safety, are also key
      topics of discussion. The development of AI is likely to reshape many
      industries and aspects of daily life in the years to come.
    </p>
